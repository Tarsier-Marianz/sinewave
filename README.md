# Sinewave

Generate 3-phase sinusodial waveforms using Arduino.

## Sample Output:

## Factors to considered to get the results

**DEFINITIONS**
*   `Am`       = is the amplitude of the waveform.
*   `ωt`       = is the angular frequency of the waveform in radian/sec.
*   `Φ (phi)`  = is the phase angle in degrees or radians that the waveform has shifted either left or right from the reference point.

**CONSTANTS**
*   `2π        `= 360 deg
*   `360deg/2π `= 57.3 deg

**FORMULAS**
*   `ƒ        `= 1/T
*   `ω        `= 2πƒ   or 2π/t  (rad/sec) angular velocity
