*   Am       = is the amplitude of the waveform.
*   ωt       = is the angular frequency of the waveform in radian/sec.
*   Φ (phi)  = is the phase angle in degrees or radians that the waveform
*              has shifted either left or right from the reference point.
*
*   NOTES
*   2π        = 360 deg
*   360deg/2π = 57.3 deg
*
*   FORMULAS
*   ƒ        = 1/T
*   ω        = 2πƒ   or 2π/t  (rad/sec) angular velocity
